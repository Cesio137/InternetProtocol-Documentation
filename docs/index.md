# Welcome

Internet Protocol exposes Websocket, HTTP, and Json modules to the blueprint. The goal of this plugin is, in addition to making it easier, to give you full control over managing connections and manipulating messages via Json.

Key Features:

* WebSocket Connections: Effortlessly establish real-time, two-way communication channels with servers using WebSockets.
* HTTP Requests: Seamlessly send and receive data with HTTP requests, supporting GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE and more methods.
* Blueprint-Friendly: Intuitive blueprint integration allows for quick and easy setup within your projects.
* Asynchronous Operations: All networking processes are handled asynchronously, maintaining smooth gameplay without big performance hitches.

## Modules

* InternetProtocol `World Subsystem`.
* Websocket `Client side only`.
* HTTP `Client side only`.
* Json.
* RawFunctionLibrary.
